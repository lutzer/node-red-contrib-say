node-red-contrib-say
====================

Output node for node-red  for tts (text to speech).
Let your computer speak the entered text.

## Preparation

### OSX
You should be lucky. All you need is preinstalled.

### Linux
Linux support involves the use of [Festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), which uses decidedly less friendly names for its voices.

### Windows
It simply does a native shell call to PowerShell and it works fine for standard use.

## Install

Run the following commando as root:
```
npm install node-red-contrib-say -g
```
