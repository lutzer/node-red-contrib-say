## Preparation

### OSX
You should be lucky. All you need is preinstalled.

### Linux
Linux support involves the use of [Festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), which uses decidedly less friendly names for its voices.

### Windows
It simply does a native shell call to PowerShell and it works fine for standard use.

## Install

Switch to your Node-RED project directory and run the following command:
```
npm install node-red-contrib-say
```

## Thanks
